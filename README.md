## About Me
I am a software engineer and educator.

I am a graduate of the New York University School of Engineering's Integrated Digital Media program, and General Assembly's Full Stack Software Engineering program. I have a strong interest in the arts (painting, singing, guitar, songwriting) and have built projects that combine my creative background with my technical skills in full stack web development. Please take a look at my projects: [here](https://davidverghese.surge.sh/webapps) 

In my previous role, I worked as a software engineering instructor at the Flatiron School. I am passionate about helping people from all sorts of backgrounds enter the tech industry, and build projects that reflect their unique life experiences and interests.
