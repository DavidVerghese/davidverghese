## About Me
I am a creative software developer and musician looking for an entry level position as a junior software developer. Thoughtful, imaginative, and enthusiastic, I apply the same passion and focus to creating aesthetically pleasing, user-focused interfaces, and coding robust applications as I do to creating soundscapes and composing songs. I seek the opportunity to join a high achieving company where I can fully develop my artistic and technical skills in programming.

I am a graduate of the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, a 4 month course with over 400 hours of professional training. In this course, I learned to construct full-stack websites and APIs from scratch, using JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.

Since graduating, I have been working as a freelance software engineer, and have gained experience with Python, Java, C++, Next.js, Wordpress, Sass, and KeystoneJS

I am also a musician. My interest in music technology, such as recording software and plug-ins, is what led me to becoming a software engineer.

I am currently working on the "Online Daw", a musicmaking website that allows users to make beats in the browser. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OT_MF8sQBU) is a demonstration video I have recently filmed.
